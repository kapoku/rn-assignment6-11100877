This repository contains the implementation of the UI design provided.

Design Choices

I used React Native to build the app, along with the react-navigation library to handle navigation between screens.
I used AsyncStorage to store the cart data locally on the device.
I used a simple FlatList to display the products and cart items.

Implementation

 The `HomeScreen` component displays a list of available products, and allows users to add products to their cart.
 The `CartScreen` component displays the items in the user's cart, and allows users to remove items from their cart.
 I used `AsyncStorage` to store the cart data locally on the device, and retrieve it when the app is launched.
